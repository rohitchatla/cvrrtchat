"heroku-postbuild": "NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION=false npm install --prefix client && npm run build --prefix client", --> removed, as it was causing problem when building in heroku push but not must need to build client before pushing to heroku, later added as the problem was with grpc(so added firebase new version("firebase": "^8.1.2") in client)
